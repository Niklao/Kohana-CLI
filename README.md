# TO-DO + Issues

If you find issues with this tool, please follow our guidelines for [reporting issues]. 
We do not use github issue system as an Apache project, we have a JIRA issue management system which covers over 30+ cli, platform, 
plugin repos in the Cordova project. Use the "CLI" component for Cordova CLI issues. However, most of the 
functionality of Cordova CLI is implemented in cordova-lib npm module. You can also use "CordovaLib" component to file issues.
